# Chp4-of-DOET Part 2
Adrian Casarez <br>

For this reading discussion, our group is responsible for leading a 30–45 minute session where we begin by 
introducing a topic or open-ended question from Chapter 4 to help ease the class into conversation, then move 
into 1–2 deeper questions that connect to the main themes of the reading while also sharing our own interpretations 
to help guide the dialogue. After that, we will design a short 5–10 minute breakout activity that allows 
classmates to think about or apply the reading in smaller groups, and then we will close with a final 
discussion before submitting our materials (such as a doc, slides, or GitHub link) for credit.

One thing that stood out to me in this chapter was how Norman can spend multiple pages passionately critiquing 
something that seems small—like light switches—but when you think about it, we do get genuinely frustrated by bad design. 
We instinctively know when something is harder than it needs to be, and we often know how it could be better. 
So the question becomes: if we understand what “good” design looks like, why isn’t everything designed that way? 
This often happens when designers attempt to “reinvent the wheel” just for the sake of being different. When a product 
goes against what users are already familiar with—without offering a clear improvement—it ends up being frustrating rather than innovative.

For example, when Norman brought up the design professionals complaining about the new elevator system (page 146), 
I found myself agreeing with them. The new “Destination Elevator” may have been more efficient in theory, but it 
introduced confusion because it changed the process too drastically. 
There was no easy way to correct mistakes—if a person selected the wrong floor, they had to restart the process entirely. 
Innovation can succeed, but usually only when the transition is gradual and intuitive. Sudden change that ignores user 
habits tends to fail because people naturally hold onto systems that already work for them.

When Norman shifted to discussing feedback, I understood this section very clearly because feedback is something I 
personally rely on a lot. I don’t always trust my instincts or “discoverability” when using something new. The shower
example (page 151) especially resonated with me. I had a similar experience at a hotel during Anime Expo where the shower
knob gave no indication of how to turn on the water or adjust the temperature. After multiple people tried pushing and
pulling on it, we nearly called the front desk for help. The lack of feedback—no sound, no click, no visual cue—made 
something as simple as turning on a shower feel confusing and frustrating. This really reinforced Norman’s point 
that strong, clear feedback is essential to good design.
