In Chapter 5, Norman argues that what we often call “human error” is actually the result of bad design, 
because many everyday systems, machines, and interfaces are created in ways that make slips, mistakes, and 
misunderstandings almost inevitable, meaning people are blamed for failures that were actually caused by unclear signifiers, poor mappings, lack of feedback, 
or confusing system behavior, which is why he emphasizes that designers must anticipate how real people think, act, 
and make errors in order to create systems that guide users toward the correct actions and help prevent accidents before they happen
