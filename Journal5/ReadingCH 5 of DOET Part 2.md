According to Chapter 5 of The Design of Everyday Things, Norman explains that what we usually call “human error” is actually the predictable result of poor design,
because people rely on limited short-term memory, are vulnerable to slips caused by inattention, distractions, or automatic behaviors, and make mistakes when designers
fail to provide clear mappings, feedback, and constraints, which means that truly responsible design must anticipate where errors are likely,
build systems that make wrong actions difficult or impossible, make the correct actions obvious, support recovery when failure occurs,
and ultimately shift the blame away from users and toward designs that ignore real human cognitive limitations.
